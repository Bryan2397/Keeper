State Management: React useState (learning in progress)

How it Works

The app currently displays note cards stored in the component state.

Users can add new notes dynamically using a form input.

React’s useState hook is used to manage the notes array and re-render the UI when changes occur.

Future updates will allow editing and deleting notes by updating the state.
